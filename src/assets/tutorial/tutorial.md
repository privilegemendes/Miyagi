Puzzle slider is a classic puzzle game in which a picture is divided into small square pieces and these pieces are shuffled. The objective of the game is to rearrange these pieces to form the original picture. The game is also known as sliding puzzle, 15-puzzle, or 8-puzzle depending on the size of the puzzle.
//
//     Here are the steps to play the game:
//
//     Start by selecting the difficulty level. Puzzle slider typically comes in 3x3, 4x4, or 5x5 sizes. A 3x3 puzzle has 8 pieces plus an empty space, a 4x4 puzzle has 15 pieces plus an empty space, and a 5x5 puzzle has 24 pieces plus an empty space.
//
//     Once you have selected the difficulty level, the picture will be scrambled and divided into small square pieces. Your goal is to rearrange the pieces by sliding them one at a time into the empty space, so that they form the original picture.
//
//     To move a piece, simply click or tap on it. If the piece can be moved, it will slide into the empty space. If it cannot be moved, nothing will happen.
//
//     Keep moving the pieces around until you have successfully rearranged them to form the original picture. Depending on the size of the puzzle, this can be a challenging task that requires a lot of concentration and problem-solving skills.
//
//     Some versions of the puzzle slider game also have a timer or move counter to keep track of how long it takes you to solve the puzzle or how many moves you make.
//
//     That's it! With a bit of practice, you can become a master of the puzzle slider game and impress your friends with your puzzle-solving skills. Good luck!
